### Profiling (EDA) :eyes:

- [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) - {naniar} provides principled, tidy ways to summarise, visualise, and manipulate missing data with minimal deviations from the workflows in ggplot2 and tidy data.

### Bases de dados :bank:

- [CRAN Task View: Databases with R](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/ctv-databases)

### Visualização :bar_chart:

- [ggplot2 extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

- [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) - {gganimate} extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by {ggplot2} to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.

- [ggstatsplot](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot) - {ggstatsplot} is an extension of {ggplot2} package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

- [ggpubr](https://github.com/kassambara/ggpubr) - The {ggpubr} package provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing {ggplot2} - based publication ready plots.

- [ggbiplot](https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot) - An implementation of the biplot using {ggplot2}. The package provides two functions: `ggscreeplot()` and `ggbiplot()`. {ggbiplot} aims to be a drop-in replacement for the built-in R function `biplot.princomp()` with extended functionality for labeling groups, drawing a correlation circle, and adding Normal probability ellipsoids.

- [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) - he goal of {patchwork} is to make it ridiculously simple to combine separate ggplots into the same graphic.

- [gridExtra](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/04/extra-extra-get-your-gridextra/) - Arranging multiple plots on a page.[Basic examples](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html) and [more](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/261-multiple-graphs-on-same-page.html).

#### Mapas :world_map:

- [ggmap](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) - {ggmap} is an R package that makes it easy to retrieve raster map tiles from popular online mapping services like Google Maps and Stamen Maps and plot them using the {ggplot2} framework.
- [Simple Features for R](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) - A package that provides simple features access for R.

#### Redes :goal_net:
